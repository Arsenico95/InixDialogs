# InixDialogs

An __MVVM__ solution for Modal Dialogs in __WPF.__

Includes:

* Message Box.
* Input Box(VB6 Style).
* File Save/Open Dialog.
* Directory Selection Dialog.

The main idea behind this project is to enable WPF developers to make fully testable ViewModels even when they need Modal dialogs to 
let the user choose a specific path through a modal dialog box.

The dialog boxes are customizable so every developer has a chance to adapt them to their own needs and UI look n' feel.
